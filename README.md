> A Zen master was out walking with his student. The student saw a fox chasing a rabbit and said to his master, "I wonder who will win?"
> 
> "According to an old fable," the master replied, "the rabbit will get away from the fox."
> 
> "Surely not, the fox is faster."
> 
> "But the rabbit will still escape," insisted the Zen master.
> 
> "Why are you so certain?" asked the student.
> 
> "Because the fox is running for his dinner, but the rabbit is running for his life."
